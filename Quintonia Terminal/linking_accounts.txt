*** Welcome to Quintonia - Queer Virtual Worlds ***

Quintonia is a queer friendly grid and welcomes all that identify as queer or LGBTI+ as well as those that don't but are happy to be in a queer environment.   Quintonia grew out of the Quintasensual festival as a place where queer people could meet and connect in 'one location' no matter where they are in the real world.
